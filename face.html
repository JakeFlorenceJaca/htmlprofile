            <!--start of the step by step on how to draw a face-->
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Materials You'll Need</h2></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pencil</li>
            <li>Eracer</li>
            <li>Paper</li>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Step 1: Draw the Basic Shapes</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start with an Oval: Draw a light, vertical oval for the head. It doesn't need to be perfect this is just a guideline.</li>
                        <li>Add Guidelines: Draw a vertical line down the center of the oval. This will help you keep features symmetrical. Then draw a horizontal line halfway down the oval. This will help you position the eyes.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li><h3>Step 2: Add Facial Guidelines</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Eye Line: Draw another horizontal line halfway between the first horizontal line and the bottom of the oval. This is where the bottom of the nose will be.</li>
                        <li>Eyebrow Line: Draw a horizontal line slightly above the eye line. This is where the eyebrows will go.</li>
                        <li>Nose Line: Draw a horizontal line slightly below the eye line. This marks the bottom of the nose.</li>    
                    </ol> 
                    <img class="img2" src="images/image1.png" alt="step1 picure" >   
                <li><h3>Step 3: Draw the Eyes</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Position the Eyes: On the eye line, draw two almond shapes on either side of the vertical guideline. The space between the eyes should be roughly the width of one eye.</li>
                        <li>Add Details: Inside each eye shape, draw a circle for the iris and a smaller circle for the pupil. You can also add a bit of shading to the iris and pupil for a more realistic look.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li><h3>Step 4: Draw the Nose</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Outline the Nose: Starting from the nose line, draw the shape of the nose. It usually consists of a small oval or circle for the tip and lines extending from it for the bridge.</li>
                        <li>Add Nostrils: Draw two small ovals or curves on either side of the base of the nose for the nostrils.</li>
                    </ol> 
                <li><h3>Step 5: Draw the Mouth</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Position the Mouth: Draw a horizontal line between the nose line and the bottom of the oval. This will be the line where the mouth will be placed.</li>
                        <li>Shape the Lips: Draw the upper lip as a gentle curve and the lower lip as a slightly fuller curve below it.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li><h3>Step 6: Draw the Eyebrows</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shape the Eyebrows: Above each eye, draw the shape of the eyebrows. They usually start thicker near the center and taper off towards the ends.</li>
                    </ol>        
                <li><h3>Step 7: Draw the Ears</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Position the Ears: Ears are positioned between the eye line and the nose line. Draw an oval or semi-circle on either side of the head, aligned with these lines.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img class="img2" src="images/image 2.png" alt="step3to7 picture" >
                <li><h3>Step 8: Add Hair and Neck</h3></li> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sketch the Hairline: Start the hairline slightly above the forehead. The shape of the hairline depends on the hairstyle.</li>    
                        <li>Draw the Hair: Add the hairstyle of your choice, keeping in mind that hair flows naturally and has volume.</li>
                        <li>Draw the Neck: Draw two lines from the base of the oval to the shoulders. The neck should be proportional to the head.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img class="img2" src="images/image3.png" alt="step8and9  picture" >
                <li><h3>Step 9: Refine and Erase Guidelines</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Refine the Features: Add details to the eyes, nose, and mouth. Adjust shapes and lines as needed.</li>
                        <li>Erase Guidelines: Carefully erase any unnecessary guidelines to clean up your drawing.</li>
                    </ol> 
                    
                <li><h3>Step 10: Finalize Your Drawing</h3></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Outline: You can use a pen or marker to outline your drawing if you like.</li>
                        <li>Shading (Optional): Add shading to give depth and dimension. Shade under the chin, around the nose, and in the eye sockets for a more realistic look.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img class="img2" src="images/image4.png" alt="step10 picture" >
                <li><h3>for Improvement</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice Proportions: The human face has specific proportions that you can practice to improve accuracy.</li>
                    <li>Study References: Look at photos or drawings of faces to understand different shapes and expressions.</li>
                    <li>Be Patient: Drawing faces takes practice, so keep experimenting and refining your skills.</li>
